# Privacy and Security in Wearable Health Technologies

## Overview
This repository contains a technical analysis of privacy, security, and regulatory considerations in consumer wearable health technologies, with a focused case study of the Apple Watch health ecosystem.

The work evaluates how wearable devices handle sensitive physiological data across device, application, and cloud layers, and examines gaps that emerge when consumer-generated health data falls outside traditional healthcare regulations such as HIPAA.

## Scope of Analysis
The analysis combines:
- A targeted literature review spanning technical, legal, ethical, and clinical perspectives
- A structured privacy and security assessment of the Apple Watch Health ecosystem
- Evaluation of encryption, access controls, data sharing, retention, auditing, and user consent mechanisms
- Actionable recommendations for healthcare providers, technology developers, policymakers, and end users

Rather than treating cybersecurity as a purely technical problem, this work emphasizes governance, transparency, and accountability across the wearable health data lifecycle.

## Key Themes
- Fragmented regulatory coverage for consumer health data
- Technical vulnerabilities in wearable ecosystems (pairing, synchronization, cloud storage)
- Privacy-by-design and security-by-design practices
- Ethical implications related to autonomy, secondary data use, and algorithmic bias
